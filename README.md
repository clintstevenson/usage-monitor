# Current Implementation
When either the mouse moves or a new window is in focus the usage is tracked.  The unix timestamp, mouse position, window name are stored.

# Coming Soon
* Build web interface in PHP to analyze usage.  Pull from S3 bucket for visualization.
* Calculate usage for web screen by what window was in focus.
* Clean up dataset
