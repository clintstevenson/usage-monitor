# usage-monitor

# Current implementation
When either the mouse moves or a new window is in focus the usage is tracked.  The unix timestamp, mouse position, window name are stored.

# Coming Soon
* Sends dataset to S3 bucket.
* Build web interface in PHP to analyze usage.
* Calculate usage for web screen by what window was in focus.
